# Hi there 👋

I'm Ollie, I'm a junior front-end developer with experience with these technologies:

- Javascript/Typescript using ES6, I :heart: arrow functions.
- Semantic HTML
- CSS/SCSS
- React
- Angular
- Node.js

I'm passionate about accessibility, and writing clean code.
Feel free to check out some of my projects:

- [Rubys Text Adventure](https://github.com/Ocoldwell/rubyscakeadventuregame)  🐶
- [Our client project](https://github.com/Ocoldwell/KnoWaste)  💚
- [A video-game deals API site front-end](https://github.com/Ocoldwell/apichallenge2) 🎮
- [Morse Code Translator using TDD](https://github.com/Ocoldwell/morsecodetranslatorollie)  🖨️
- [A calculator](https://github.com/Ocoldwell/calculator-project)  🥧
- [Etch-A-Sketch](https://github.com/Ocoldwell/etchasketch)  :pencil2:

I'm constantly tweaking with these as I love refactoring and improving test coverage.

- 🔭  I’m currently working on my portfolio website, using React whilst implementing framer motion [here](https://github.com/Ocoldwell/React-portfolio).
- 🌱  I’m currently learning Angular, Java, C# and Node.js among others. I plan to get to Elixir at some point.
- 🐡  Outside of coding? I love reading fantasy books and going on hikes with my dog.
