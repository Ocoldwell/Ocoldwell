# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ollie, I'm a front-end developer who works mainly with these technologies:

- Javascript/Typescript
- Semantic HTML
- CSS/SCSS and design systems like Bootstrap and Tailwind.
- React, in particular using Next.js and hooks.
- Angular
- Node.js

I'm passionate about accessibility and attempting to write clean code.

- ðŸŒ±  I currently write code in Next.js professionally, with previous experience using Angular so I try to spend lots of time getting to grips and mastering this. I'm interested in other languages and am working my way up to proficiency in a few.
