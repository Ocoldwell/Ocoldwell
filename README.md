# Hi there 👋

I'm Ollie, I'm a front-end developer who works mainly with these technologies:

- Javascript/Typescript
- Semantic HTML
- CSS/SCSS and design systems like Bootstrap and Tailwind.
- React, in particular using Next.js and hooks.
- Angular
- Node.js

I'm passionate about accessibility and attempting to write clean code.
Feel free to check out some of my projects:

- [Rubys Text Adventure](https://github.com/Ocoldwell/rubyscakeadventuregame)  🐶
- [Our client project](https://github.com/Ocoldwell/KnoWaste)  💚
- [A video-game deals API site front-end](https://github.com/Ocoldwell/apichallenge2) 🎮
- [Morse Code Translator using TDD](https://github.com/Ocoldwell/morsecodetranslatorollie)  🖨️

- [Etch-A-Sketch](https://github.com/Ocoldwell/etchasketch)  :pencil2:

- 🌱  I currently write code in Next.js professionally, with previous experience using Angular so I try to spend lots of time getting to grips and mastering this. I'm interested in other languages and am working my way up to proficiency in a few.
