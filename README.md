# Hi there 👋

I'm Ollie, I finished a bootcamp called Nology recently, which gave me quite a few skills in:

- Javascript/Typescript using ES6, I :heart: arrow functions.
- Semantic HTML
- CSS/SCSS
- React
- Angular
- Node.js

I'm passionate about accessibility, and writing clean code.
Feel free to check out some of my projects:

- [Rubys Text Adventure](https://github.com/Ocoldwell/rubyscakeadventuregame) 🐶
- [Our client project](https://github.com/Ocoldwell/KnoWaste) 💚
- [A video-game deals API site front-end](https://github.com/Ocoldwell/apichallenge2) 🎮
- [Morse Code Translator using TDD](https://github.com/Ocoldwell/morsecodetranslatorollie) 🖨️
- [A calculator](https://github.com/Ocoldwell/calculator-project) 🥧
-[Etch-A-Sketch](https://github.com/Ocoldwell/etchasketch):pencil2:
I'm constantly tweaking with these as I like to go back over old code to improve on it.

- 🔭  I’m currently working on my portfolio website, using React whilst implementing framer motion [here](https://github.com/Ocoldwell/React-portfolio).
- 🌱  I’m currently learning C# and ASP.net as I appreciate strongly typed languages.
